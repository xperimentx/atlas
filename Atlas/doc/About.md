# Goals

This is a personal project, a learning project ,but useful for my work.

It does not pretend to replace the big PHP Frameworks. 

I will copy ideas and solutions from  acclaimed frameworks and great libraries in my own way, just for fun, just for lean.

Reinventing the wheel is one of the most rewarding ways to learn, understand and honor the work of others.


### The important goals list

* Have a god time !! :)
* Create a open source project
* Little by little, in my spare time. Fun :D
* Based on the my old yualah Atlas code, but now simpler! , cleaner! ... and all those good things.
* Share with everyone in open source Atlas, dedicated especially to all those who selflessly publish their work on the internet, of which I have learned so much
