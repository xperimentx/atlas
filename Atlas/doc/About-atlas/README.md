# Objetives
This is a personal project, a learning project ,but useful for my work.

It does not pretend to replace the big PHP Frameworks. 

I will copy ideas and solutions from  acclaimed framworks and grat libraries in my own way, just for fun, just for lean.

Reinventing the wheel is one of the most rewarding ways to learn, understand and honor the work of others.
