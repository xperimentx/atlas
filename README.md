# Atlas Php Toolkit
Atlas is a development toolkit for small PHP projects.

It does not pretend to replace the big PHP Frameworks. But share with those who may be useful the tastes and preferences of a group of senior developers who, to create small projects, prefer to use their own tools instead of oversized frameworks. Although helped by fantastic third-party libraries, such as FPDF, XpertMailer, ...

The idea is to release new Atlas version but now in open source.
Little by little, in my spare time.


## Code stlye
To some extent it is similar to the PSR standards, with some differences in intent, braces and naming that we decided already in the year 2003, regardless of the programming language used:

* Indent and braces: **Allman style**

* Using **snake_case**
  * Classes, namespaces, methods and functions: with capital initial.
  * Variables in lower case.
  * Contans  all in upper case

## Objectives
* Fun.
* Clean, improve documentation and homogenize code.
* Make compatible with autoload PSR-4.
* Implement Auth modules, Api Rest, PSR-7.
* Basic DB migrations.
* Update the crud and control modules using api rest and AJAJ to offer a more dynamic experience.
